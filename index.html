        <h1>Tracing Guns to Stop Violence</h1>

        <p class="dek">Our new analysis finds that some U.S. cities outperform others in tracing guns used in crimes back to their original owners.</p>

        <p>Many people might point to Detroit, Michigan and think of violence or a high crime rate, but according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), the Midwest city has almost 84% of firearms recovered and traced back to their purchaser. That is one of the highest rankings in the entire country.</p>

        <p>When considering gun violence in major U.S. cities, Chicago often comes to the forefront of national conversations. With a population nearing 2.75 million, Chicago is no stranger to high-profile gun violence incidents. According to recent data, 74.9% of the firearms recovered in Chicago were successfully traced to their purchasers.</p>

        <p>Likewise, Detroit, Michigan, has long struggled with gun violence and its associated criminal activity. Yet, Detroit’s gun tracing efforts have proven successful, with 83.9% of firearms recovered being traced to their original purchasers. Despite facing significant social and economic challenges, these high trace percentages are linked with an ATF field division in Detroit that is actively working to combat the illegal flow of firearms into the city.</p>

        <p>“ATF is committed to protecting the public and reducing violent crime in neighborhoods across Michigan,” said James Deir, the Special Agent in Charge. He added, “Individual cases may originate within one team, but a spirit of collaboration within our Division and with our international, Federal, State, and local partners is often key to successful investigations.”</p>

        <p>Milwaukee, Wisconsin, provides an even more striking example of successful gun tracing. The city has the highest percentage of firearms traced back to their original purchasers, with an impressive 88.3% trace rate. This strong performance places Milwaukee at the forefront of cities effectively combating gun violence through better tracking and accountability.</p>

        <p><iframe title="Percentage of Guns Traced Back to Purchasers vs. Population in California Cities" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-7SOBF" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7SOBF/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="499" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();

        <p>In contrast, California cities like San Diego and San Jose have notably low gun trace rates. San Diego, with a population of 1.3 million, trails with the lowest percentage at just 57.9%, raising questions among law enforcement officials and crime analysts alike. Similarly, San Jose struggles with a trace rate of 67.1%, despite California’s reputation for strict gun laws.</p>

        <p>Further complicating the situation is the issue of gun trafficking. While gun tracing is an effective tool, it can only go so far in dismantling illegal trafficking networks. In cities like New York and Philadelphia, where gun violence is often linked to out-of-state trafficking, tracing a firearm back to its original purchaser is just the beginning. Collaborative efforts between states and federal agencies are essential to address the root causes of gun violence.</p>

        <p>The importance of gun tracing cannot be overstated. As cities like Chicago, Detroit, and Milwaukee continue to make strides, there is hope for broader national improvement. At the same time, cities like San Diego and San Jose must enhance their tracking systems and strengthen collaboration with federal agencies to make meaningful progress.</p>

        <p>In an interview with Sandy Hook Promise, a non-profit organization created after the school shooting in Connecticut, representatives highlighted ways citizens can help prevent future illegal firearm use: “Be aware of direct threats or people bragging about access to weapons and recruiting accomplices or audiences for attacks,” they said. Vigilant citizens can play a role in reducing gun violence.</p>

        <p>As the ATF data shows, cities with strong gun tracing programs are taking significant steps toward reducing gun violence and holding those responsible for trafficking firearms accountable.</p>
